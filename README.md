# Global_Terrorism_MachineLearningProject

US spending on counter-terrorism efforts is nearly $100 billion per year. When an attack occurs, identifying the group tied to it is one of DHSâ€™s main responsibilities. Taliban and ISIL are the ones that are most responsible for global terrorism attacks.

This project develops the model to minimize when the model says that the Taliban / ISIL was not responsible when they were.
